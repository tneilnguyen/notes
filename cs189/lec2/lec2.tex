\section{Classifiers}
You are given \textbf{sample} of \(n\) \textbf{observations}, each with \(d\) \textbf{features}.  Some observations belong to \textbf{class} \(C\); some do not.  Example:
\begin{itemize}
\item Observations are bank loans
\item Features are income and age (\(d=2\))
\item Some are in class ``defaulted,'' some are not
\item Goal: Predict whether future borrowers will default, based on their income and age.
\end{itemize}
Represent each observation as a point in a \(d\)-dimensional space, called a \textbf{sample point/feature vector/independent variables/predictors}.
